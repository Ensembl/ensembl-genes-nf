The statistics consist of the following scores:

BUSCO score:
measure of completeness of genome assembly and annotation of gene set
It has been calculated in protein mode using the canonical transcripts (filename: <>_busco_short_summary.txt) and in genome mode to check the accuracy of the annotation system (filename: <>_genome_busco_short_summary.txt).

OMArk score:
measure of proteome completeness, based on the presence or not of conserved genes of the target lineage  (filename: <>_omark_proteins_detailed_summary.txt).
